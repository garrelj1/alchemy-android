Base application to get projects off the ground quickly

# TODO
After pulling down this repo to use for a new project, it requires a few changes

1. Change the `R.string.app_name` value to your new app name
2. Change the `rootProject.name` value in `settings.gradle`
3. Change the `applicationId` value in the `app` module `build.gradle`
